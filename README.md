# Proma (in progress)
API designed to manage employees' work in the company and organizing the tasks assigned to them.

## ❓ How it works
Users are allowed to create their account. Each account holder can join the existing organization or create his own. 
Organizations have employees, teams and tasks that we can manage if we have sufficient permissions.
